        "Hi there ! As someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for 25 years, I would say that crying is nothing to worry about at all ! Almost every single person I have worked with has cried at one point or another . Starting therapy takes a lot of courage when you work with a therapist, once you feel safe, you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before . I have seen people cry with sadness, cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time, cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard . I myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving . I can assure you that most, if not all, therapists expect clients to cry and there is nothing to be embarrassed about . Crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down . Crying is often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal . So, to summarize, do not worry at all about crying ! It will probably feel uncomfortable at first, but I promise you, you will not be judged for crying in therapy . And it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and will not judge you ! Good luck ! !",

That way you are using facts rather than opinions and things that can be observed rather than subjective emotional decisionsi would also be curious with what your brother sees in this girl, and I might even recommend starting with thati cannot underline enough the importance of having this come across as genuine, and for lack of a better word, gentlei also be very honest with you that I cannot guarantee that he will react positively, neutrally, or even that he will have the discussion with youbecause it is true that he could choose to continue dating this girl and perhaps even hold it against you for a while, I would also encourage you to look at the importance of this to you and where you consider the riskbenefit ratio to be .",
        "For starters, commend yourself for being committed to working . You have no idea what is going to happen in the next second, so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story . Remind yourself of that every time the thought pops up . The false belief that nothing good will happen is sucking out energy you can use on pursuing your career dreams . Next, do you know what you need to do to become an electrician or heavy machinery operator ? If not, find out . Then, set up a realistic schedule for yourself to accomplish the steps . As you accomplish each step, see your progress . Notice that you are moving closer to your goal . Every day remind yourself why you are pursuing this career . In fact, write it down and tape it on your bathroom mirror . When you start to feel discouraged, remember your goal and remind yourself that you have no idea if you will make it or not but you are going to give it everything you have to find out . Anything worth pursuing is going to take a lot of persistence and hard work . Stay with it ! You and your family are worth it !",
        "Do the two of you ever talk over why he does this or your reaction to itare you asking your question because his behavior upsets you or only out of curiosity to understand him betterbasically, first know your own reason for your question . Then go ahead and tell him if what he does bothers you . In the best of cases, he does not realize how his actions affect you and he will change .",
        "Let us just start with being real . Expressing yourself is vulnerable, and being vulnerable is hard . It takes courage and work to be vulnerable . My guess is that you have been shown in your lifetime that being vulnerable ie, expressing yourself is unsafe . My assumption would be you have been criticized, or ignored when you have expressed yourself in the past, it has taught your emotional self to simply not do it again . This is a normal protective mechanism that you have used to cope with past feelings of hurt . It will take time and work to engage again in an emotional wayi would start my practicing and identifying how you feel to yourself . Check in with yourself multiple times a day to gage where you are at emotionally . After you feel you have a good grasp on this, start to engage in emotional conversations with others . Choose others that feel safe to you, a good friend that knows you well, or a sibling or family member . Expressing yourself is a behavior that you have suppressed out of protection, so you can choose to engage in safe emotional expression behaviors just the same . Best of luck !",
        "Life is beautiful without unwanted thoughts and stress . With proper strategies and tools it is possible to regain control over your thoughts . I guess you are just having thoughts and not actually hearing voices ? My suggestion is to see a therapist and go from there .",
        "Choosing the right therapist can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming . I know many people come to therapy with hesitations and potential fears but a therapist should be there to help you along the way and support you as you build a trusting and collaborative relationship . You will not have to train your therapist to give you what you need . Through open dialogue and feedback you and your therapist, together, can determine what works best for you . But do remember that being able to trust your therapist to guide and support you is key . So if you are having a hard time connecting with your therapist after 34 sessions, you will want to bring it up to them so you can discuss any barriers and if needed, request a referral for another therapist .",
        "I am sorry to hear about the trust issues in your relationship . Trust, as you clearly know, is essential to healthy relationships . Past indiscretions or dishonesty can damage this trust and make it really hard to confidence that these things will not happen again despite reassurances . We tend to be very sensitive to betrayal and risks to our relationship security . Rebuilding trust takes time and effort for both parties . On your end, you may need to provide more reassurance and more concrete evidence that you are trustworthy, gestures of transparency eg . - giving him more information about where you are going and who you will be with, letting him know when you get texts or emails from people that might give him pause or trigger insecurities, and more patience and empathy for his fears . On his end, he may need to learn to be with his insecurities and fears and ask for reassurance about your love and commitment in ways that do not lead to criticizing you, attempting to control you, or limiting your freedom . If you are not able to come to agreements about how to put his fears to rest without it negatively impacting your life, I would suggest getting some professional help from a marriage counsellor or couples therapist .",
        "It sounds like you are pulling away instead of being honest . If you really want to be with him, why not now ? If you do not have time for a relationship, why are you dating at alli do not understand the whole phasing out thing that people do these days or ghosting, where you just stop talking and disappear ! . I get the sense that this relationship is not working for you, but for some reason you are stopping yourself from being honest with yourself and him and just ending it . In the early stage of a relationship the first year, if it does not feel fabulous, it is a good idea to move on . It is not personal . You do not owe this person anything . They deserve someone who is totally into them and so do you and you are doing him no favors by hanging on to something that is not amazing or giving him hope that it might work better in the future sometime . You do not have to slowly bow out . It actually creates more hurt than gentle honesty . Maybe people do not know how to say iti have decided not to continue with this . I wish you the best . Life is too short !"

        "Your question highlights your pain very clearly . What you are describing is one of the most common scenarios I see in my practice with couples one partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward . My mind immediately goes to a question for you what happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for ? What do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship ? What do you do in response to these feelings ? Do you ask for what you need ? Does this lead to arguments ? Do you stay silent or withdrawvery often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship and is often seen as cold and aloof towards the relationship, and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other and is often seen as critical and nagging . Regardless of who started it, these patterns can turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship . If both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together . As the patterns slow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that does not leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared forsome couples can do this without the help of a therapist . The book hold me tight 7 conversations for a lifetime of love by sue johnson is a selfhelp book based on emotionally focused therapy the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists, and has been helpful to many couples that I see . When a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals, I recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy such as emotionally focused therapy . You can learn more about eft or find an eft therapist here summarizeyour pain is understandable and valid . It is telling you what you are missing and what you wantreconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us, express those feelings in a safe way, and assert our wantsneeds, while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partnerif you can do that on your own, and your relationship is responsive, that is fantastic !

        "Maybe you can start with having 15 minutes per week that you know you will be spending time with each other even if it needs to be on the phone . Because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time, at least you would know there was that time that was set aside . That may also help you to rekindle some conversations between youas far as your little fights, consider spending five minutes with one of you talking about one issue that is a concern and the other partner asking questions that are openended cannot be answered with just yes or no and listening as an investigative reporter to try to learn more about what the other person is experiencing . Then, once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from, switch . It is also good to restate what you think you are hearing . Then you know what each other is truly following about this . Also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement, just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming fromalso consider noticing what makes you feel valued, special, loved, or appreciated . Think of the same for your girlfriend . This could be a great discussion to have as well ."

        "It has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal . Often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue . For some, depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated, they discover that they are anxious worried about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief . When there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts either in their mind or in practical application to resolve the anxiety, depression is often the result . In this type of case, depression is not the main or underlying issue . The anxiety is the underlying issue . Having a lot on my mind sounds like anxiety . Unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with emptiness . In the question above, I would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having a lot on my mind and determine where these might be coming from . Has there been ongoing rejection from peers ? From family ? If so, why does this seem to be happening ? Isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain . Where does that need to protect originate ? Are there unmet needs from childhood ? Are there traumatic life events that have created a need to selfprotect as a defense mechanism ? We can feel alone even when in a crow of people or at a party . This has nothing, in this case, to do with being around people . It has more to do with how we view ourselves . If there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says, you are worth nothing or you do not deserve the company of others then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it . I would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time . The developmental needs meeting strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs . If there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people, then emdr can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma . Looking at whether this individuals issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy .",
        "Hi enid, you sound like a sensitive parent I like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong . There is some key information here I do not know your sons age, whether he spent any money, whether he put the card back, or how many times he is stolen, and my answer might be different depending on those details, but I will give you my thoughtsi see it as every childs job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world . In order to accomplish that, many of them test limits . What can I get away with ? Is a question they have to find the answer to . If a child knows the rules, they are much more likely to not test limits because they already know the limits . So, part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying . Not all kids steal, but I would say pretty much every child lies at some point . It is a normal behaviour, and most of the time it is about small things that do not matter and we do not even find out . Stealing a debit card is a bit more serious, and I am not surprised he lied about it . If you absolutely know that he took it, it is okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it . It is appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour, so that the child does not do it again . The consequence should be as natural and logical as possible . The behaviour stealing was harmful to you, so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea . It is funny, because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad, but they know they will get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest we do not want people to know our mistakes . It is a dilemma . If you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell him that you will not give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day . That gives him incentive to come to you with truth . It sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth . You can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty . Put a cookie on the counter . Tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day . Then ask them later if they took the cookie . You are making honesty fun . Kids love games . Basically, there is as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative . If this is the first serious offence for your son, do not make a big deal of it consequence him and see if he learns . If it is a pattern, that is different and you may want the input of a therapist .",
        "It sounds like you may be asking two different questionswith regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom, I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this . If you choose to do that, I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience . This can be difficult to do at times, particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type . Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion . It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like what, how, who, where, when . Questions that start with why, can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood . Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly . If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years, it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially . Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying, just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing . I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation, but this could be done with many different topics over timeyou could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are havingas far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience, maybe if you can discuss what it is that you do not like andor understand what it is that he does like, you could see if there is some middle ground here . It depends on what you both preferthese types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples, at least initially . Having structured conversations, such as the ones I have described briefly above, can feel awkward initially, but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argumentalso consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas .",
        "Contact your daughters school and ask for an occupational therapy evaluation . An occupational therapist can determine if your daughter struggles with eyehand coordination, visual processing or sensory motor difficulties . The therapist will develop a plan of care if your daughter demonstrates delays or difficulties in learning . Otonthegoorg mobile therapy that comes to you ! Accepting most insurance .",
        "Of course not . Counseling is a process, whereby you and your therapist will help you create goals- starting with issues that are most pressing and interfering with your daily functioning . When anxiety and daily stress is more manageable then you and your therapist can examine more deep rooted or more chronic issues .",
        "Sometimes relationships just do not work . Do not feel that the first, second, or even third relationship is the relationship you are suppose to be in for life . The one that is meant for you will require work but should be be draining and a constant roller coaster of breaking up . It is good you all went to counseling, but one or two sessions may not be enough to make and see a change in behavior . It takes times and it takes both working toward the same goal . I would suggest doing you meaning focusing on your own growth at the time . If he wants to grow with you, he will make the necessary steps . If he does not wish him well ."
